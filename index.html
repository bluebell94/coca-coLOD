		   		<p class="lead">This project aims to analyse the video advertisement as whole and also in its sub-parts – the song, the scenes of the video and the video advertisement as a whole as well as the slogans shown during the ad. Apart from that a goal of the project is also to represent the messages which are not explicit and remain non-verbal but are transmitted through the advertising video. All this will be done by applying certain computational tools. Based on the computational results will be created a knowledge graph which illustrates the structure behind the advertising strategy of Coca-Cola campaign “taste the feeling”, what kind of approaches they are using in order to tackle the target audience and will make explicit the connection between all this and the structuralism of Saussaure(signified, signifier).</p>

		            <p>The managers of Coca-Cola are trying to tackle the young people, especially those who are still not fans of the product and encourage them to try it. The Coca-Cola product is presented within different aspects of our daily life and associated with a wide variety of actions, feelings and emotional states. So as to be able to apply it in any kind of event and situation. The idea is to associate the product with any kind of action that the public might prefer and any situation from our daily life. What is in the core is to promote the concept of having this carbonated drink as a companion in our everyday life.

		            <p>In the advertisement of Coca-Cola we are able to observe 2 ways of communication – verbal and non-verbal. This is a strategic move that brings a lot to this campaign as the communication tries to convey a particular message, to encourage customers’interest and to popularize a certain brand. By using both verbal and non-verbal communication, what the target audience receives also much complex messages from the non-verbal communication methods. The non-verbal communication goes far beyond what is on surface and what is obvious and well-known. It is trying to construct a concept, by employing the advantages of verbal and non-verbal communication so that the message that is being transmitted to the customer is stronger and the approach is on different levels, not just by text messages, but also by visual representations.

	            	<h3 class="h05">Semiotics in Advertising</h3>

		            <p>Semiotics are frequently used in advertising as an approach to transmit an advertiser's message through the usage of signs or symbols. A sign by its own can be better understood  in different ways as a signifier – having more or less literal meaning, or as a symbol that signifies points to else. In some cases, the sign can be an exact representation of the thing being signified, while in other cases, it may be a symbol associated with it. The use of semiotics in advertising is in many ways much more connected with the process than with a single action, because by the tools of the semiotics the advertisers are able to create not just positive feeling, but also loyalty towards a brand. This process of branding trequires much longer time and is being done by employing  repetition, combinations of symbols, bringing words, images and music together to create one whole completed concept, that the customer will associate with the single product and consequently with the brand.

	   				<h3>Communication model</h3>
		   			<h1>Verbal and non-verbal communication</h1>  			

	   			<p>In the advertising video we are able to distinguish two basic approaches for communication - verbal and non-verbal. The verbal one we are able to observe in the slogans that are appearing in the different scenes of the video. It is quite interesting that in all of them lacks an essential part for the construction of a basic phrase or a sentence - a verb. So that the supposed activity or action is left to be imagined by the public. The verbal approach is also observed in the lyrics of the song of the advertising video. However, this could be easily interpreted in the model of RDF triples.
	   			</p>
	   			<p> <img src="images/rdf_triples.png"></p>
	   			<p style="color:darkblue; font-size: 22px; letter-spacing:1px "><b>Wordclouds, representing the lyrics of the song and the slogans during the advertisement video:</b></p>

	   				<img style="display:right; width:48%" src="images/wc-slogans.png">
	   			</div>

				<p>The other approach is the non-verbal communication which basically uses different kind of emotions, facial expressions, body signs and gestures in order to implement certain ideas and concepts. In regards to this approach from the scenes in the video, we are able to observe a wide range of different emotions as surprise, happiness, exciytement, exhilaration and others. Apart from that most of the people in the video are smiling and are almost always in the company of others, which implies the idea of sharing something positive.  
				</p>
				<p><h5>Qualitative descriptive analysis:</h5>
					<img src=images/scene-description1.jpg>
				</p>
				<p>In regards to the different understanding and perception of the advertisement from the different aged groups, I am putting a link to a research, that shows how the young are mainly focused on the experience and the different emotions related with the product, associating it with their own experience, while as the poeple are more mature they are thinking of Coca-Cola in more practical terms. No matter that the video is quite more about relating the product with stories and events, they still accept the product as something that is used when you are thirsty, to awaken your senses, giving you power and refreshment.</p>
				<p>To sum up, what is important is that we are able to observe both types of communication - verbal and non-verbal, but they are perceived in different ways in regards to the age group. The older age group focuses their attention more on the physical characteristics of the product as being able to make you refreshed.<br>
				The young respondents after watching the advertisement underlined the product's emotional role - as a motivator, companion, and even entertainer.</p>

	   			<img src="images/words-compare.jpg">
	 			<p class="lead">After applying the algorithm those are the results in regeards to the most frequently used words. The word that is most frequently used in the inscriptions being showed as part of the verbal communication is the preposition “with”. Even this mere fact once again puts another emphasis on the idea of combining 2 things, of having two things that go well together, that you usually imagine as something connected and related. The preposition “with” is used as a bridge that is allowing the connection between two nouns, no matter the omission of the verb. It constitutes a relationship between the nouns and allows us to come to a logical deduction what could relate these two nouns. The second most-used word is exactly the name of the product that is being promoted. It is the thing on which our attention should focus on. The interesting part is that the first 2 most frequently used words in the inscriptions are implying a wide range of possible connections and it all depends just on us to pick up a preferred way to relate them.This also has to do with the repetitions that we are going to observe closer further on.
				The second table represents the lyrics of the song of the advertisement. There we see an interesting pattern – we have a wide range of different pronouns. This is another sign that the authors are trying to create a personal experience. Another relation we can see is applying that the most frequent words from the 1st table go really well with these from the 2nd – so that we have – “Coca-Cola with you”, “Coca-with me”, “Coca-Cola together”, etc.

	 			<p class="lead">The majority of the words as we see are used twice in the insciptions, and we are seeing an obvious repetition. One phrase finishes with a certain word and the consequent ones starts with the same word. This further makes us more concentrated on the meaning and leaves us time to employ our imagination, creativity and past experiences in order to create our own concept strating from a few keywords.
				Most of the words imply the presence of more people like for example – “love”, “secrets”, “fun”, “friends”, “stories”, “strangers”. In all of these cases we have the implication that there is more than one person. That what is being experienced is being shared. This is like a continuation of the effect of the preposition “with”, implies that there is not just some connection between the nouns, but that in most of the cases we talk about a group of at least 2 people.</p>

		            <p>
					In the food advertising the use of conceptual metaphors is quite extensive in order to arouse customers’ interest. By conceptualization of different aspects related to the product into various entites and objects, the marketing strategists present us one whole conceptual idea, not just a single product. The idea is to provide us with many different scenarious of its usage and application, to show how us all of its advantages and how it could change our lifestyle. In the advertisement of Coca-Cola “Taste the feeling”, we are able to observe this in the following slogans :” Fire with Coca-Cola”, “Coca-Cola with smiles”, "Fun with Coca-Cola". These slogans can’t be interpreted literally, but provide us the idea of an association with gathering around fire with friends,laughing and sharing something funny in a cosy atmosphere or about sentiments of affection and the beginning of a relationship. These phrases create the idea of Coca-Cola as a product that makes you feel positive, relaxed and in a cosy and friendly atmosphere.

		            <p>Ontological metaphors are used often in order to be interpreted as entity and are based on our past experience. In our case in the phrase “Taste the feeling”, we are able to interpret “feeling” as an entity, because it refers to a sequence of events happeningthat have the task to create this so called “feeling. The feeling itself involves different sensations and emotional states. In some people tasting Coca-Cola, might provoke hunger, a crave to drink even more of it, happiness, satisfaction, stimulationby others – even anxiety if they are not used to high caffeine and blood-sugar levels. The feeling that is trying to be communicated by Coca-Cola marketeers is much more like whole experience with many stages, because the idea behind the main slogan “Taste the feeling” has the implication that it last for longer time, it is not just a single moment in time, but a feeling that is being followed by a sequence of positive emotions.

		            <p>Metaphors connected with personification are also used in order to create the overall idea of Coca-Cola.We are able to observe such in the following inscriptions: “Coca-Cola with smiles”, “Coca-Cola with love”, “Fun with Coca-Cola’’, “ You with Coca-Cola”. In all of the following phrases when we are talking about Coca-Cola, no matter that we know that it is a non-alcoholic beverage, our mind makes an association with somebody or a group of people, because usually we are smiling when we are around friends, when we talk about love we always think about more than one person. When we are trying to imagine having fun, it is always associated with a group of friends, relatives, family, etc. Because all of this, the image of Cocca-Cola becomes personificated and the idea about has and added value to the literal meaning as a carbonated refreshing drink in a glass bottle.

		   		<h1>Saussaure Structuralism</h1>  			
		   		
		   		<p class="lead">In this advertising campaign we are able to see the structuralism employed by Saussaure. By definition structuralism is a system in which each element in a group can only be understood by its relation ti other elements as part of a larger structure.in its core is the study about conveying messages. His theory is based on the idea that each language is made up pf signs. Furthermore, each sign is made up pf two parts – a signifier and a signified. The signifier is the pointing finger, the word, the sound-image. It is in the interpretation of the signifier that meaning is created.</p>
		   		<p><img src="images/signifier.jpg"></p>
				<p class="lead">The signified is the concept, the meaning, the thing indicated by the signifier. 
				It doesn't need to be a 'real object' but is some referent to which the signifier refers.
				The thing signified is created in the perceiver and is internal to them. Whilst we share concepts, we do so via signifiers.
				Whilst the signifier is more stable, the signified varies between people and contexts.
				The signified does stabilize with habit, as the signifier cues thoughts and images.
				In the example of the advertising strategy applied by Coca-Cola in this video – we are able to see how the authors of the ad are trying to focus our attention on the signified. They are allowing us the free our mind, be creative and employ our imagination and so that to constitute whatever relationship we would like with their product. For some Coca-Cola signifies refreshing taste, for others boost of energy, for some it reminds of eating pizza with friends and many other interpretations that are more or less connected with personal stories and experiences.

                   Chief Marketing Officer Marcos de Quinto, who unveiled the “one brand” approach at a media event in Paris, said the strategy extends the equity and iconic appeal of the world’s No. 1 beverage brand to Coca-Cola Light/Diet Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero and Coca-Cola Life. It also underscores the company’s commitment to choice, offering consumers whichever Coca-Cola suits their taste, lifestyle and diet – with or without calories, with or without caffeine.

                  <p>
                  We are reinforcing that Coca-Cola is for everybody,” de Quinto said. “Coca-Cola is one brand with different variants, all of which share the same values and visual iconography. People want their Coca-Cola in different ways, but whichever one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and refreshment.
